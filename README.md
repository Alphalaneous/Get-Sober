## <cr>THIS MOD IS LINUX ONLY</c>

Replaces the Wine file browser and console with a system one if available.

You need to have xterm for the console to be properly replaced. If it is not installed already, please install it.

This is experimental and may not work on all systems. It is built on one case which is my own system. I have zero clue if it will work anywhere else.
